# Angry Birds Style Slingshot Prototype (WhiteHat Jr Project)

This project is an early **physics-based slingshot experiment** inspired by Angry Birds.  
It was created during my early programming learning days with WhiteHat Jr and demonstrates:

- Slingshot mechanics  
- Physics-style object launching  
- Collision with blocks and pigs  
- Background sprites and simple animation  

This is **not a full game** — it is a **mechanics prototype** focused on slingshot + collision logic.

## 🎮 Core Features

### 🏹 Slingshot System
- Player drags the bird using the **mouse**  
- Direction + force depend on **drag distance**
- Auto-release if held for too long  
- Launch behaves like basic projectile motion

### 🧱 Collision Logic
- Bird collides with:
  - Blocks  
  - Pig sprites  
- Objects react on collision (simple movement/displacement)

### 🌄 Visual Elements
- Background images  
- Multiple sprites  
- Basic animation workflows

## 🧠 Learning Purpose
This project helped me understand:

- How slingshot force and direction work  
- How to track mouse drag vectors  
- Basic physics simulation  
- Sprite collision and hit detection  
- Game loop logic (p5.js or WhiteHat Jr environment)

This became the foundation for my later interest in **Python game logic**, automation, and programming.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**
- **p5.js** / **WhiteHat Jr environment**
- Basic physics & sprite manipulation

---

## 📌 Current Status
- No scoring system  
- No win/lose condition  
- Core mechanics fully functional  
- Preserved intentionally as a **learning prototype**

---

## 📘 Notes
This project represents my early game development journey and shows my understanding of **mouse input, physics, and collision logic** at a young age.
