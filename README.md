# Angry Birds Style Slingshot Prototype (WhiteHat Jr Project)

This project is an early **physics-based slingshot experiment** inspired by Angry Birds.  
It was created during my early programming learning days with WhiteHat Jr and demonstrates:

  - Slingshot mechanics  
  - Physics-style object launching  
  - Collision with blocks and pigs  
  - Background sprites and simple animation  

This is **not a full game** — it is a **mechanics prototype** focused on slingshot + collision logic.

## Core Features

## 🏹 Slingshot System
  - Player drags the bird using the **mouse**  
  - Direction + force depend on **drag distance**
  - Auto-release if held for too long  
  - Launch behaves like basic projectile motion

## Collision Logic
  Bird collides with:
  - Blocks  
  - Pig sprites  
  - Objects react on collision (simple movement/displacement)

## Visual Elements
  - Background images  
  - Multiple sprites  
  - Basic animation workflows

## Learning Purpose
This project helped me understand:

 - How slingshot force and direction work  
 - How to track mouse drag vectors  
 - Basic physics simulation  
 - Sprite collision and hit detection  
 - Game loop logic (p5.js or WhiteHat Jr environment)

This became the foundation for my later interest in **Python game logic**, automation, and programming.

 🛠 Technologies Used
 - **JavaScript**
 - **p5.js** / **WhiteHat Jr environment**
 - Basic physics & sprite manipulation

## 📌 Current Status
 - No scoring system  
 - No win/lose condition  
 - Core mechanics fully functional  
 - Preserved intentionally as a **learning prototype**

## 📘 Notes
This project represents my early game development journey and shows my understanding of **mouse input, physics, and collision logic** at a young age.
